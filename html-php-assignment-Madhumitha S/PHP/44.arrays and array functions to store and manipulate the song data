// Playlist management using arrays and array functions

// Step 1: Create some songs
$songs = [
    ["title" => "Shape of You", "artist" => "Ed Sheeran"],
    ["title" => "Blinding Lights", "artist" => "The Weeknd"],
    ["title" => "Someone Like You", "artist" => "Adele"],

// Step 3: Add songs to the playlist
array_push($playlist, $songs[0], $songs[2]); // Add Shape of You and Someone Like You

// Step 4: Display the playlist
echo "ðŸŽµ Playlist:\n";
foreach ($playlist as $song) {

// Step 5: Add another song

OUTPUT:

ðŸŽµ Playlist:

- Someone Like You by Adele

ðŸŽµ Final Playlist (Sorted):

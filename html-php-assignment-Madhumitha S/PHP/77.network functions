OUTPUT:


=== Addressing & Name Resolution ===
Examples: DNS, DHCP, ARP
Purpose: Identify devices and map names to addresses.

=== Routing & Forwarding ===
Examples: RIP, OSPF, BGP
Purpose: Determine and forward data packets through the best path.

=== Monitoring & Management ===
Examples: SNMP, NetFlow, Ping, Traceroute
Purpose: Monitor network devices, traffic, and performance.

=== Security ===
Examples: Firewall, IDS/IPS, VPN
Purpose: Protect network from unauthorized access and attacks.

=== Quality of Service (QoS) ===
Examples: Traffic shaping, Latency monitoring, Jitter control
Purpose: Prioritize and manage network traffic for critical applications.

=== Discovery & Topology ===
Examples: LLDP, CDP, Nmap
Purpose: Discover network devices and visualize topology.

=== Service & Access ===
Examples: HTTP, FTP, Proxy servers, Load balancers
Purpose: Provide network services and application access.
